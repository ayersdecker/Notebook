## What does this site do? 
I needed a simplistic way to pull up captions on a computer. The goal is to make an easy to use site that did just one thing, closed captions.

## Progress 
- [x] Access Browser Microphones
- [x] Connect to Captioning Service (via JavaScript)
- [x] Feed Response back to Screen
- [x] Add a Lightweight Clock to Screen
- [x] Adjust Reponse to use 3 Lines
- [x] Add buffer to 3 Line Approach
- [x] Add Timeout to Captions after short delay

> Site Superseded by Reflex Project

- [ ] Prevent Microphone Timeout from Browser 
- [ ] Layout Clock in Corner with Captions Centered
- [ ] LightMode v DarkMode
- [ ] Text-Scaling and Font Options (OpenDyslexic and SuperSans)

## Development
This site is being developed during my time at NTID CAT Lab. It is my personal research into Captioning Services, and how to create one. <del>I plan to finish the site to some capacity and publish it with a custom domain</del>. I will frequently provide updates as I develop.
